# php-custom-error-handler

A super simple, clean and pretty error handler that replace the default error handler of PHP.

You need just include only this file at the beginning of the script.

```php
include 'custom-error-handler.php';
```

Note that this script is based on PHP 8 or later, if you use a previous version, you need to comment Match Expression and to decomment Switch Statement.

Enjoy!
