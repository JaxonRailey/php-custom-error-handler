# Custom error handler

![Custom Error Handler](https://github.com/JaxonRailey/php-custom-error-handler/blob/main/handler.jpg?raw=true)

A super simple, clean and pretty error handler that replace the default error handler of PHP.

You need just include only this file at the beginning of the script.

```php
include 'custom-error-handler.php';
```

Note that this script is based on PHP 8 or later, if you use a previous version, you need to comment Match Expression and to decomment Switch Statement.

Enjoy!
